TF2 HUD based off of Overwatch 2.

Notes:  
If you don't like how far away the health/ammo is from the center, turning on minimal mode (cl_hud_minmode 1) will move the health/ammo to the center of the screen. (https://i.imgur.com/Im28G5K.png)  
Currently I haven't edited the mann vs machine HUD elements. I plan on doing them at a later date.  
Crosshairs are managed in resources/ui/HudPlayerClass.res.

Resolution Support:  
16:9 - Made on 1920x1080, should work on other resolutions  
16:10 - Should work, maybe some slight offsets.  
4:3 - Not useable. Lots of hud elements that are simply just gone or way too offset.
