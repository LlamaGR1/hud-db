# skyhud

A TF2 Head's Up Display, inspired by many other existing huds, and focused on simplicity.

## Installation

Download the HUD .zip file and extract the main file (named "skyhud-master") into your TF2 custom folder in the following file path: steam/steamapps/common/teamfortress2/tf/custom
Also make sure that skyhud is the only hud present in the custom folder, otherwise you might experience issues and even game crashes.

## Customization

All customizations are in the "customization" folder and are fully documented. If you intend to use any customizations, please read **ALL** "README.txt" files
