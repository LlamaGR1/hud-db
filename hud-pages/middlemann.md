# Description

Vanilla Centered TF2 Hud with default health and ammo in the middle. It clears the clutter and keeps the shit.

**In other words**, this *TF2* HUD moves everything to the center of your screen while keeping the default *TF2* art style that we all SHOULD love. It's middle, & it's modern.

**In other-other words**, this is NOT another generic hud with random numbers floating at the centre of the screen. You weirdos.
