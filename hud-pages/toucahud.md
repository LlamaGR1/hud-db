The HUD combines two of my favorite HUDs, CollyHUD and HExHUD, into something tailor-made for me and my interests as a competitive TF2 player. This HUD won't change the world or travel back in time to fight Professor Poopypants, but I want to show it off and, maybe, make someone's day in the process!

Thank you to Hypnotize, Colly, and Omnibombulator for inspiration and development on HExHUD and CollyHUD respectively! Thank you to Jofre for the time spent and dedication to helping make this HUD as great as it can be for me!

--For those interested in changing your resolution to 4:3--

All 4:3 folders are in the customization file, as well as the original 16:9 folder in case you want to change back, with instructions for installation. Since this is a first revision of 4:3, we ask that you guys experiment with the assets to iron out anything we may have missed.

The customization tab that we were thinking of implementing will not be added, I'm sorry if that is something that you may have wanted. We have reverted most changes to the ones we made in November 12th with some optimizations and fixes for issues caused by the Halloween Update. I'm sorry this took so long to bring out, I procrastinated and was not invested into the well-being of this HUD for a bit of time. With that said, I hope the HUD works well for y'all! Happy New Years!
