# yesodHUD

A minimalistic custom HUD for Team Fortress 2, base was collyhud created by colly. This HUD was my approach at reworking/updating collyhud, as it is pretty outdated. This originally started as a HUD for myself, but decided to expand it for others.

The customizations include:
- Ammo
- Color Scheme
- Medigun
- Spy Disguise
- fonts
- Chat positions
- Damage
- Health styles
- 3D Model
- Scoreboard
