A simpler HUD mod, and the first one I've ever made!  
Most changes are of the in-match hud, elements designed purely by me

## HEALTH

A heart; the "foreground" does not change as you take damage due to restrictions with SV_Pure :(

## AMMO

All charge bars, counters, and the ammo are located to the right as per usual, surrounding the ammo background

## MATCH STATUS

Match status bar (the top) has been redesigned too!

## LEADERBOARD

Just a bit more compact is all!

## MENUING AND BUTTONS

Stained **red** with the **blood** of enemies, and cherry juices; moved some of the buttons, not much more from that!

_**DOES NOT SUPPORT MIN-MODE (yet?)**_

All elements (should) work in Valve servers!  
May be awkward in Comp, as that is untested  
Thank you, please enjoy!
