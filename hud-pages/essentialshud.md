#### Notes

- This is a public HUD that can be used for non-EssentialsTF events. We kindly ask that you give credit in return whenever the hud is used in videos or live content.
- To get the most out of this HUD's features, install the latest [CastingEssentials](https://github.com/dalegaard/CastingEssentials/releases) by [dalegaard](https://github.com/dalegaard).
   - A list of CastingEssentials commands used with this HUD can be found [here](https://github.com/CriticalFlaw/essentialsHUD/wiki/Common-Commands).
